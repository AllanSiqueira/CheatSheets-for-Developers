## Create React App

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Simple Reactjs Functional Component

```
function App() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```
