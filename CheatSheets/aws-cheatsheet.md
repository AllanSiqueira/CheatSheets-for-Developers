# AWS Cheatsheet

The AWS Console is a web interface that you log into to manage your AWS services. In contrast to the AWS Console is AWS CLI. It is a great tool to manage AWS resources across different accounts, regions, and environments from the command line. It allows you to control services manually or create automation with scripts.

#### Config:

 - Create profile:
	```
	aws configure --profile profilename
	```
- Specify AWS Region
	```
	aws configure region (region-name)
	```
